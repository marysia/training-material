    "# Palmer Penguins: a machine learning example\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "The data was collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antartica LTER. The goal of the dataset is to provide a great dataset for data exploration, visualisation and - in this case - a demonstration of the scikit-learn API. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scikit-Learn\n",
    "Scikit-learn is *the* library for machine learning in Python. You could consider it the swiss army knife of machine learning. A wide variety of machine learning models are implemented by the community and core developers, with a consistent API. Once you master this API, it's easy to apply a wide variety of machine learning algorithms, and you have a handy tool to help you out with preprocessing, model evaluation and model selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why scikit-learn?\n",
    "- Many available machine learning models\n",
    "- Models are implemented by an expert team and checked by a large community\n",
    "- Covers most machine-learning tasks\n",
    "- Commitment to documentation, consistency and usability\n",
    "- Designed to work with other key Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Penguin classification\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate classification of penguins species based on bodily measurements with the scikit-learn API. We will cover the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading the data\n",
    "2. Preparing the data for sklearn\n",
    "3. Model creation & evaluation\n",
    "4. Model visualisation "

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "## 1. Loading our data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many places your data can originate from. Maybe you want to load it from a Excel file you have stored locally on your system, maybe you have a .csv file stored online somewhere. Scikit-learn comes with various standard datasets that can be used for practice, that can be loaded if you have scikit-learn installed on your system. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the dataset we will be using today (the Palmer penguins dataset) does not come from scikit-learn, but from a visualisation package called `seaborn`. A dataset loaded from seaborn will be a Pandas dataframe and can be used as such. Pandas is a powerful library for data wrangling."

    "Scikit-learn is an excellent, resourceful tool for machine learning in Python. We've seen how we can split a dataset with `train_test_split` into a train and test set, create and train a model, use the trained model to create predictions, and how to use the tools from `sklearn.metrics` to evaluate how good the model is.
